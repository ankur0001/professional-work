## Full narration

### Opening — start with a problem

In the previous episode, we worked through **Records**. That gave us a piece of the platform. Today we need the next piece: **Sealed Classes**.

We are continuing The Java Story, and today's challenge is Sealed Classes. The goal is not to memorize a definition — it is to understand a problem Java is trying to help us solve.

Sealing closes a hierarchy so switches and readers can be exhaustive.

I am not going to rush through slogans. We will introduce the idea in context, explain why it exists, look at Java code, walk through that code, and only then move on.

### Why this exists

In simple language, sealed classes is a tool for a recurring design problem. If we ignore that problem, we can still write code for a while — and then the cost shows up as duplication, fragile APIs, runtime surprises, or code that only the original author understands.

A helpful picture: Keep a simple picture of Sealed Classes.

Hold that picture lightly. We will come straight back to Java so the analogy clarifies the mechanism instead of replacing it.

### Building the idea step by step

#### Step 1

Now consider this teaching point: permits lists allowed subtypes.

This is usually the first thing you need in your mental model. If this step is fuzzy, the later details will feel like trivia.

Say it back in your own words before we look at code. If you can explain the 'why', the syntax becomes much easier to remember.

#### Step 2

Now consider this teaching point: Enables exhaustive switch checking.

Notice how this extends the previous step. We are not collecting disconnected facts — we are assembling a mechanism.

Say it back in your own words before we look at code. If you can explain the 'why', the syntax becomes much easier to remember.

#### Step 3

Now consider this teaching point: Pairs well with records.

Ask yourself: if we skipped this detail, what bug or design smell would become more likely?

Say it back in your own words before we look at code. If you can explain the 'why', the syntax becomes much easier to remember.

#### Step 4

Now consider this teaching point: Models closed domains honestly.

Ask yourself: if we skipped this detail, what bug or design smell would become more likely?

Say it back in your own words before we look at code. If you can explain the 'why', the syntax becomes much easier to remember.

#### Step 5

Now consider this teaching point: Open hierarchies stay unsealed on purpose.

This last point is often where beginners and experienced developers separate. Tutorials mention it. Production work depends on it.

Say it back in your own words before we look at code. If you can explain the 'why', the syntax becomes much easier to remember.

### Example 1 — the smallest useful illustration

Let's start with the smallest example that still teaches the real idea. Read it slowly. Every line is doing work.

```java
sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rect {}
record Circle(double r) implements Shape {}
record Rect(double w, double h) implements Shape {}
```

Why is this code here? Because an abstract definition is easy to nod at and hard to use. The example forces the idea into a concrete shape.

I'll walk this example like we're pair-programming.

Focus on the idea each line encodes.

Then we connect it to the production failure mode.

Look at `sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rect {}`.

Ask what would break if this line were missing, mistyped, or replaced with a 'simpler' shortcut. That question turns syntax into understanding.

Look at `record Circle(double r) implements Shape {}`.

Ask what would break if this line were missing, mistyped, or replaced with a 'simpler' shortcut. That question turns syntax into understanding.

Look at `record Rect(double w, double h) implements Shape {}`.

Ask what would break if this line were missing, mistyped, or replaced with a 'simpler' shortcut. That question turns syntax into understanding.

After this example, you should be able to point to the code and explain what problem each important line is solving.

### Example 2 — make it more realistic

The first example isolates the concept. Real applications rarely stop there. In a practical setting, Sealed Classes usually appears while you are trying to ship a feature under constraints: correctness, readability, and change over time.

So extend the idea: once the basic form works, ask what happens when the input is larger, the call sites multiply, or another teammate must maintain the code next month.

A useful habit is to take the small example and place it inside a tiny scenario — a checkout flow, a student record, a background job, a service boundary — whichever fits the topic. The concept should still be visible, but now it has a reason to exist in a product.

When you rewrite the example in that scenario, keep the same mechanism. Do not invent a new idea. You are proving that the same Java tool still works when the story gets closer to production.

### What if we skip this approach?

Important concepts become memorable when we see the failure mode without them.

For example, consider this common mistake: Sealing everything by fashion.

That mistake is attractive because it feels shorter or more familiar. The cost arrives later: a subtle bug, a painful refactor, or an incident that is hard to diagnose.

This is the 'what if?' test. If removing the concept makes dangerous behavior easy, then the concept is earning its place in the language or the standard library.

### Example 3 — a common misunderstanding

**Misunderstanding 1:** Sealing everything by fashion.

When you see this in a code review, do not only say 'that is wrong.' Explain the mechanism. Show the safer pattern. Connect it back to the reason the feature exists.

**Misunderstanding 2:** Forgetting to update permits when adding types.

When you see this in a code review, do not only say 'that is wrong.' Explain the mechanism. Show the safer pattern. Connect it back to the reason the feature exists.

**Misunderstanding 3:** Using sealing where plugins must extend freely.

When you see this in a code review, do not only say 'that is wrong.' Explain the mechanism. Show the safer pattern. Connect it back to the reason the feature exists.

If you can diagnose the misunderstanding, you are no longer memorizing — you are teaching yourself to design.

### Interview-style checkpoint

Question: Why seal a hierarchy?

Answer in spoken form: So compilers and humans know the full set of subtypes — safer refactors.

Then add one sentence about a trade-off or failure mode. That extra sentence is what makes the answer sound like experience instead of a flashcard.

### Connecting the thread

We came from **Records**. That set up a need. **Sealed Classes** is one of Java's answers to that need.

You should now be able to say why the idea exists, how a small Java example works, where you would use it, and what people often get wrong.

### Looking ahead

Once this is solid, a new challenge appears. That challenge leads us to **Modules and JPMS**.

We will start there the same way: with a problem, then the reason Java's approach exists, then code we can walk through together.
